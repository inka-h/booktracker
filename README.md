# booktracker

Quick late-night personal project to track books I've read in a simple graphical UI.

There is an installer is in /installer, code in booktracker.py, the installer version doesn't require having the .py

This thing creates a books.json file in the folder the script is in.

Currently the installer path for the shortcut is wrong (whoops!) - it can be fixed by rightclicking -> properties -> change path from "booktracker.exe" to "Book Tracker.exe".

# booktracker

Quick late-night personal project to track books I've read in a simple graphical UI.

There is an InnoSetup installer in /installer, code in booktracker.py, the installer version doesn't require having the .py

This thing creates a books.json file in the folder the script is in.

FEATURES:
- "add book" section can be collapsed
- search and filter AND sort by clicking headings
- multiple dates are allowed (re-reading already read books without overwriting dates)
- load different .json files

Ideally manual editing of .json should not be required at all :)
